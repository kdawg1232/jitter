ðŸ¤– Great question! Let me break down exactly what each piece does and give you a clear implementation plan based on your specific widget requirements.
What Each Component Does
1. iOS Widget Setup (ios-widget-setup.md)
Purpose: Creates the actual visual widget that users see on their home screen
What it contains:
SwiftUI views that display your scores and timer
Widget timeline system that tells iOS when to update the widget
Interactive buttons (Add Drink, Checkmark) using iOS 17+ App Intents
Widget configuration that defines sizes and appearance
2. Native Bridge (ios-native-bridge.md)
Purpose: Allows your React Native app to communicate with the widget
What it does:
Writes data to App Groups (shared storage between app and widget)
Triggers widget updates when you log drinks or update scores
Manages timer sessions that the widget can read and display
Bridges the gap between JavaScript (React Native) and Swift (Widget)
Your Widget Requirements â†’ Implementation Plan
Based on your specific needs, here's what needs to happen:
Widget State 1: Default View
Apply to widgetplansu...
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
Widget State 2: Timer Active
Apply to widgetplansu...
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
Implementation Flow
Phase 1: Data Pipeline Setup
What happens: Your React Native app pushes live data to the widget
When you log a drink â†’ WidgetService.updateWidgetData() â†’ Native Bridge â†’ App Groups â†’ Widget shows new scores
When you update sleep â†’ Same flow â†’ Widget reflects new crash risk
Real-time score updates â†’ Widget always shows current focus/crash scores
Phase 2: Widget User Interface
What happens: User sees and interacts with widget on home screen
Default state: Shows current focus score (78) and crash risk (42)
Add Drink button: User taps â†’ Widget switches to timer mode
Timer display: Shows live elapsed time (updates every 10 seconds)
Checkmark button: User taps when done sipping
Phase 3: Timer Functionality
What happens: Widget manages its own timer state
User taps "Add Drink" â†’ Widget starts timer, stores session in App Groups
Timer updates â†’ Widget timeline refreshes every 10 seconds to show new time
Visual feedback â†’ Widget shows "Sipping..." and live elapsed time
Phase 4: Completion & Handoff
What happens: Widget hands control back to your app with timing data
User taps checkmark â†’ Widget creates deep link with session ID
Deep link opens app â†’ jitter://complete-drink?sessionId=12345
App receives timing data â†’ Pre-fills drink form with elapsed time
User finishes in app â†’ Adds caffeine amount, completion percentage, etc.
Critical Implementation Order
Step 1: Build & Install Development Build
Wait for EAS build to complete
Install on physical device (widgets don't work in simulator)
Step 2: Create Widget Extension in Xcode
Open project in Xcode
Add Widget Extension target
Configure App Groups for data sharing
Step 3: Implement Data Flow
Add native bridge module to iOS project
Connect React Native â†’ App Groups â†’ Widget
Test data updates work
Step 4: Build Widget UI
Implement SwiftUI views for both states
Add interactive buttons with App Intents
Set up timeline provider for updates
Step 5: Implement Timer Logic
Widget starts/manages its own timer
Timeline updates every 10 seconds during active timer
Handle session data storage
Step 6: Deep Linking Integration
Complete button triggers deep link to app
App receives session data and pre-fills form
User completes drink logging in app
Why This Architecture?
Widget Limitations: iOS widgets can't run continuous JavaScript like your React Native app. They need:
Native Swift code for the UI and interactions
App Groups for shared data storage
Timeline system for updates (iOS controls when widgets refresh)
Deep linking to hand complex tasks back to the main app
Your React Native App: Handles the complex stuff (calculations, storage, user input)
The Widget: Handles simple display and basic interactions
Native Bridge: Connects the two seamlessly
What You'll Actually Build
5 Swift files for the widget extension
2 Objective-C files for the native bridge
App Groups configuration in Apple Developer Portal
Deep link handling (already done in your React Native code)
The widget will feel like a natural extension of your app, but technically it's a separate mini-app that communicates with your main app through shared data and deep links.
Ready to start implementing once your EAS build finishes?
